"""
Plain-text extraction and rebuild for Plain Text Mode (EPUB).

Walks an XHTML <body> in DOM order, collecting block-level paragraphs as plain
strings and anchoring any <img> they contain to their parent paragraph index.
The LLM never sees inline markup or images — only the textual content of each
block. The one exception is <ruby>, whose reading would otherwise be glued to
its base: it is folded into base（reading） first (see ruby_annotations).

At rebuild time, the body is wiped and reconstructed as a flat sequence of
block elements (<p>, <h1..h6>, <li>, <blockquote>, <pre>, and a container
such as <div> that held its text directly, see _collect_blocks) plus, after each
block that originally contained images, an extra <p class="plain-text-images"> wrapper
with the original <img> elements unchanged. Each block element is rebuilt with
its original tag *and the source attributes that still apply to a flattened
block* (class, id, style, dir, title, epub:type), so semantic attributes
survive translation even though the tag's inline children are flattened to
text — see CARRIED_ATTRIBUTES for what is copied and why. Void blocks (<hr>)
carry no text and no images: they keep their own slot in the paragraph list and
are re-emitted as a bare element at the same position, without ever reaching
the LLM. The one case where the body is left alone is a page that yielded no
block at all (everything inside a DROP_TAGS subtree, e.g. an SVG-wrapped
cover): its source markup is kept verbatim.
